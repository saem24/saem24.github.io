Hello visitor!

This is my personal website where I aim to elaborate on things in a way that cannot be done within the confines of a single-page resume. I hope you enjoy what you see here.
___

I am a Mechanical Engineer by education and a constant learner by passion. I like to teach and share my knowledge which is why I established <a href="https://saem24.github.io/#bft">Bright Future Tutorials</a> almost a decade ago.

When not busy with work, I love to undertake [personal projects](saem24.github.io/projects "Link: Projects"). They showcase my interest towards learning new things and tinkering along the way. I also have a well-received [research project](saem24.github.io/publications "Link: Publications") which demonstrates my research skills.

All in all, I aim to keep breaking through my comfort bubble and make new friends and memorable experiences along the way. If you wish to, you can check more of my professional profile on <a href="{{ site.linkedin_url }}" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>. Alternatively, you can message me on <a href="{{ site.telegram_url }}" target="_blank">Telegram</a><i class="fa fa-telegram" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
