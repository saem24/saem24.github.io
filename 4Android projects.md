Here is my <a href="/#proj">Project 1</a>.

**This section of this website is WIP due to my main device being repaired. I will update it soon.**

The main focus of these projects are to make QOL improvements reflecting my vision on how a feature should be in existing products I own. I sometimes also try to mimic features that tend to be version or device exclusive and bring it to other devices.

***Some of my projects:***

* <a href="/#project1">Only show notifications when an authorised face/finger is detected.</a>
* <a href="/#project2">Private listening - Reroute audio to earpiece on command.</a>
* <a href="/#project3">Anti-reboot to prevent kernel panic.</a>
* <a href="/#project4">Regex based call blocker.</a>
* <a href="/#project5">Context based autoresponder.</a>
* <a href="/#project6">WhatsApp message scheduler.</a>
* <a href="/#project7">Personalised FTP server.</a>
