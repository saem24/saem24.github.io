**This section of this website is WIP due to my main device being repaired. I will update it soon.**

#Android Projects

The main focus of these projects are to make QOL improvements reflecting my vision on how a feature should be in existing products I own. I sometimes also try to mimic features that tend to be version or device exclusive and bring it to other devices.

***Some of my projects:***

* <a href="/#project1">Only show notifications when an authorised face/finger is detected.</a>
* <a href="/#project2">Private listening - Reroute audio to earpiece on command.</a>
* <a href="/#project3">Anti-reboot to prevent kernel panic.</a>
* <a href="/#project4">Regex based call blocker.</a>
* <a href="/#project5">Context based autoresponder.</a>
* <a href="/#project6">WhatsApp message scheduler.</a>
* <a href="/#project7">Automated FTP transfer.</a>
* <a href="/#project8">Autosave records to file.</a>

# Engineering Projects

I like to learn new software and play around with them. So far I have managed to understand REVIT, AutoCAD, ANSYS, SolidWORKS, Tekla and MATLAB with varying success. This section of the website showcases some of the projects I created in the process.

***Some of my projects:***

* <a href="/#eng1">A relative's house I designed in REVIT.</a>
* <a href="/#eng2">An iPhone concept I made in SolidWORKS.</a>
* <a href="/#eng3">Calculation of static load using ANSYS.</a>
