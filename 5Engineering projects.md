**This section of website is WIP as the projects are not as polished as I want them to be. Stay tuned.**

I like to learn new software and play around with them. So far I have managed to understand REVIT, AutoCAD, ANSYS, SolidWORKS, Tekla and MATLAB with varying success. This section of the website showcases some of the projects I created in the process.

***Some of my projects:***

* <a href="/#eng1">A relative's house I designed in REVIT.</a>
* <a href="/#eng2">An iPhone concept I made in SolidWORKS.</a>
* <a href="/#eng3">Calculation of load using ANSYS.</a>
