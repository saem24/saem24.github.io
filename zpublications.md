##### Research title:
An integration of failure modes and effect analysis with grey relational analysis for CNC lathe machines.

##### Authors:
Mr. Saem Sarguroh, Dr. Santosh D. Dalvi, Dr. Chandrababu D.

##### Description:
Many modern manufacturing industries use CNC machines due to the increased speed, accuracy and flexibility it provides. Due to the complexity of these machines, a downtime results in considerable losses. I used FMEA and GRA to identify and prioritize the different failure modes, improve reliability, minimize downtime and proposed an ideal preventive maintenance
plan for my case study.

##### Status:
Submitted with the help of my professor Dr. Santosh D. Dalvi. You are free to send me a request if you would like to take a look.
